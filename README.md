# Automated-Evaluation-of-Usecase-Diagram-Using-LLMs
Developed an automated, rubric-based system using LLMs to evaluate UML use case diagrams by converting them into PlantUML text and applying semantic similarity scoring. The system improves grading accuracy, reduces subjectivity, and enables efficient, reliable assessment of student submissions.
